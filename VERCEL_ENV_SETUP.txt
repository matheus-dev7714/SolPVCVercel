=================================================================
IMPORTANT: Your .env file is NOT deployed to Vercel
=================================================================

The .env file is only for LOCAL development and is not included
in your git repository or Vercel deployments.

YOU MUST ADD DATABASE_URL TO VERCEL MANUALLY!

=================================================================
DO THIS NOW (Takes 2 minutes):
=================================================================

1. Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: SolPVCVercel
3. Click "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
4. Click "Add New"
5. Enter these values:

   Name: DATABASE_URL
   
   Value: postgresql://postgres:passionate_123@db.sssvrlmmhrbatxdfwtes.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require

6. Check these three boxes:
   ✓ Production
   ✓ Preview  
   ✓ Development

7. Click "Save"

=================================================================
WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
=================================================================

- .env file = Local development only (not committed to git)
- Vercel environment variables = Production deployment
- They are SEPARATE systems!

Your local .env has the connection string, but Vercel doesn't 
know about it until you add it to their dashboard.

=================================================================
AFTER YOU ADD IT:
=================================================================

Vercel will automatically redeploy your application with the
database connection, and your 500 error will be fixed!

=================================================================
